1. i have update all the talbes and titles to the right format

2. i need to do test for 
 - all the parsing of the MSQColname, MSQString, int, float, etc.
 - all the original test, especially for the join-helper, i am not sure all the copy process that i cange from string to the MSQColname will make any difference, note that i have some contains() method in join helper that i am not sure can work the same way
 - because i cange the title and body from string to the class instance, i need to specially check all the copy method
 - the operation method, especially the NOVALUE minus method.
